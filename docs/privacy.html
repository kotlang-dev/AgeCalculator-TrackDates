    <p class="updated">Last Updated: July 31, 2025</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Age Calculator – Track Dates</strong> ("the App"), available for Android and Desktop, and developed by
        <strong>Mohammad Arif</strong>, is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines our practices
        concerning data.
    </p>

    <h2 class="privacy-section-title">1. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The App is designed to function entirely offline. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data
        from our users. All information you enter, such as dates and occasion names, is stored exclusively in a local
        database on your device.
    </p>

    <h2 class="privacy-section-title">2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not integrate with any third-party services, including analytics, advertising networks, or cloud
        storage providers. Your data is never shared with any external entity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="privacy-section-title">3. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally, it is permanently deleted from your device if you choose to uninstall the App.
    </p>

    <h2 class="privacy-section-title">4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect any information from users, including children under the age of 13. The App's
        functionality is self-contained on the user's device.
    </p>

    <h2 class="privacy-section-title">5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. We encourage
        you to review this policy periodically.
    </p>
